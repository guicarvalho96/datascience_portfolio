# Guilherme Carvalho
<sub>*Data Science Student*</sub>

As a Mechanical Engineering Student, I decided to get closer to the universe of Data Science. 

During my professional life, I have always used programming such as VBA, Excel and C ++ to automate my tasks in several areas as IoT (Internet of Things), AGV (Automated Guide Vehicle), Financial Analysis, Mechatronical Engineering, Dashboard Creation, Data Import/ Export, Data Analysis, Automated Evaluation of Reports based on Technical Standards and others. 

Since then, I decided to specialize in Python with a focus on Data Science to deepen my acquired knowledge and apply it in real situations to solve problems or to reach informative conclusions for decision making.

**Background in:** Python, Excel, VBA, PowerBI, Arduino, Inspection Engineering, Truck Performance Data Analysis, Data Extraction using Web Services and Data Analytics.
